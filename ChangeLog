New features in robinhood 2.4:
* rbh-du and rbh-find: "du" and "find" clones querying robinhood's database
  Faster way to search for entries in a filesystem!

  Performance comparison for a 1 million entries Lustre v2 filesystem
        find /lustre -user foo -type f -size -32M -ls
        (no possible criteria on OST index)
        > 58m13s

        lfs find /lustre -user foo -type f --obd lustre-OST0001
        (no possible criteria on size)
        > 20m46s

        rbh-find /lustre -user foo -type f -size -32M -ost 1 -ls
        > 1.2s

* Directory reporting: top directories per dirent count, per avg file size
  (useful for small file hunting)
* File size profiling: global, per user, per group, per fileclass...
  (+additional section in webUI)
* Sorting user/groups by size range (eg. percentage of files < 1G)
  (useful for small file hunting)

* Partial scans to update only a subset of the filesystem.
  => allow distributed scans by splitting the namespace into
     partial scans running on multiple clients.
